The primary purpose of this repository is to have a public place to track all of my work towards the Google Data Analytics Certificate through Coursera, eventually including the project.

It serves the secondary purposes of
  1) Allowing me to fill out my activity heat map a little bit, and
  2) Getting me in the habit of making frequent contributions to GitHub
  
When you're just starting out, merely showing up is progress.
