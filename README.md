The purpose of this respository is to demonstrate my efforts to earn the Google Data Analytics Certificate via Coursera, including the capstone project.

The skills demonstrated by this certificate include:
  1) Strength in Excel, SQL, and R, and exposure to Tableau,
  2) Data preparation, processing, analysis, and storytelling, and
  3) Understanding of the principles and best practices of data analytics.
  
I will consider this respository presentable once I have completed the capstone project and finished the one course that remains.
